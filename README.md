Spearbit Labs Assessment Report

Here is how I approached the problem:

1. Read the question, thought of an approach I was going to implement.
2. Gave ChatGPT my approach and asked it to give me the necessary code in typescript.
3. Created repo and the files and used the code GPT gave me.
4. It didnâ€™t work
5. (Well, Well, Well)
6. Manually inspected the code and found issues in the backend, but frontend was pretty solid with no errors
7. Checked locally, app ran fine, but was taking too long.
8. Used gpt 4 for api calls, and shortened my prompt query as the amount of money I lost due to api calls was more that the number of job rejections I have gotten in the past year.
9. Finally, I had to nerf my application and limited it to 10 files per repo and 300 lines per file
10. Locally, my app was ready
11. VERCEL COULD NOT BUILD MY APPLICATION
12. It was fine though as I fixed the dependencies and itâ€™s been happy sailing ever since.
